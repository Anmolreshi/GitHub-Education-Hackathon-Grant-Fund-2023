## Event Summary

- What made your hackathon special or unique? <br>
DandyHacks is the University of Rochester’s annual 42-hour hackathon. This year was our 12th anniversary! As a fully student-led organization at a tier 1 research university, we embody our school’s values,
encouraging participants to question the world and learn more. DandyHacks is very beginner-friendly, and we welcome students from all backgrounds and majors. Participating in DandyHacks is not just about
winning; it is about collaborating with peers, learning from mentors, and gaining valuable experiences.
- Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on. <br>
We had board games on Friday and VR headsets all night on Saturday. The workshops we had were a "How to make a good presentation" workshop by our UI/UX Club, a GoDot development workshop by our Game Dev Club,
a Resume-Building booth by our Greene Center, a Video Game & Tutorial workshop with our Fighting Game Club, and the exciting MLH GitHub Co-Pilot and MS Paint Bob Ross workshops.
- How was **GitHub** featured at your event? <br>
Participants were required to have a public GitHub repository with their projects for a valid submission. They were also encouraged to use it for version control and collaboration during hacking.
- *We’d love to see pictures if you have them!* <br>

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>
The grant funds went to funding our snacks and our meals. More specifically, they helped fund our midnight boba, Subway sandwiches, Chick-fil-a sandwiches, and pizza!
- How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? <br>
The snacks and the meals were very popular and we had little to no leftover food for each meal. The hackers were very excited about boba and Chick-fil-a.
