# {GDSC Hacks 2024}
 - **May 3 - 5 2024** 
 - **University of Guelph** 
 - **Google Developer Student Club | UOG** 
 - **Canada, Ontario, Guelph** 

## Event Summary

- One of the key aspects that made GDSC Hacks unique compared to other hackathons was the absence of a 
specific theme for participants to follow when creating their projects. This allowed hackers to think 
outside the box and pursue the topics they are interested in and want to explore. <br>

- Of the 30+ events that occurred during GDSC Hacks, our most popular events included Nerf Showdown, 
dodgeball, learning to code with GitHub co-pilot, and the several tech talks that we hosted by Google 
Developer Experts and Professors. <br>

- GitHub played a significant role in GDSC Hacks. MLH hosted a workshop on learning to code with GitHub 
co-pilot which allowed participants to gain experience with this powerful AI tool. Additionally, GitHub was 
utilized for project submission which enabled participants to collaborate seamlessly amongst each other. <br>

## Impact of GitHub Grant

- The GitHub grant greatly assisted in funding GDSC Hacks 2024. With the additional 
funding we received from the GitHub grant, we were able to afford more merchandise for 
our participants. The shirts, bags, and stress ball we gave to participants greatly added 
to the experience and gave participants a token to remember their experience during GDSC Hacks 2024.
