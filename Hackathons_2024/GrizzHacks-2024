## Impact of GitHub Grant
- We used the funds provided from the Github grant to provide incluive nutriitonal food every single one of our participants. We had a lot of hackers who were Vegan or Halal we had to account for an the Github grant made it much easier to do so.
- We were able to provide a much better experience during meals, and were even able to provide one off meal vouchers for students who could not eat what we provided. 

## Top Projects
- We had a ton of amazing projects, I was blown away by the throughfulness of the ideas and ingenuity of the students to pull them off
- Definitely the coolest project that was made at GrizzHacks was an AI hat made for people with impaired vision. This projected showcased GPT's vision API capabilities in explaining things happening externally in real time.
- We made sure every single hacker had a github repo attached to their project submission so it could be judged.
- What made them special? _Include the link to their website, Devpost or video._
