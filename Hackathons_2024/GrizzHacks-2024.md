# GrizzHacks 6
Oakland Unversity's 6th annual Hackathon, GrizzHacks 6, held on March 9-10th, 2024. Held in Rochester Hills, Michigan

## Event Summary
This was a rebooted event, 


- Our Hackathon was special because it was a reboot for a commuter University. It was very difficult even bringing awareness to our students that an event like this even exists. It took a small team of ours a lot of outreach and a ton of effort restoring what once was a pretty big event at our college.
- For our first Hakcathon back, we wanted to keep it fairly bare bones so we didn't distract hackers too much and didn't make costly mistakes. That said, our raffle held after every talk and workshop went well in addition to our teaming up with board and video game clubs at our school to give hackers a game break.
- Github was featured in the sponsorship materials, on our shirts, and in every single project that was uploaded to devpost

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- We used the funds provided from the Github grant to provide incluive nutriitonal food every single one of our participants. We had a lot of hackers who were Vegan or Halal we had to account for and the Github grant made it much easier to do so.
- We were able to provide a much better experience during meals, and were even able to provide one off meal vouchers for students who could not eat what we provided. 

## Top Projects
- We had a ton of amazing projects, I was blown away by the throughfulness of the ideas and ingenuity of the students to pull them off
- Definitely the coolest project that was made at GrizzHacks was an AI hat made for people with impaired vision. This projected showcased GPT's vision API capabilities in explaining things happening externally in real time.
- We made sure every single hacker had a github repo attached to their project submission so it could be judged.
- [DevPost proejct gallery](https://grizzhacks-6.devpost.com/project-gallery).. Each project was special in it's own way and it was amazing to see how the personailty of each group that we got to know well over the 24 hours was shown off in their project idea.

## Whatâ€™s Next?
- We are coming back stronger for GrizzHacks 7. We managed to raise a ton of money nearing our event date and will have the means of growing a ton this next year!
- We are thinking of doing around the same time. Early March made a lot of sense with all school schedules.
