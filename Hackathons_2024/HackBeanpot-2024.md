## Impact of GitHub Grant
The GitHub grant helped HackBeanpot tremendously. From procuring swag to ordering 6 meals for hundreds of hackers over the course of our hackathon, our hackathon could not be half as vibrant and as successful if without GitHub's help. 
As a result of the grant, our hackers were able to enjoy activities such as a sunrise boba walk, succulent plants making, and various bonding activities that make our hackathon beyond a coding challenge, but more so an amazing opportunity for different technologists from diverse backgrounds to network and bond.

## Top Projects
100% of hacker submissions used GitHub.
DiscountBytes is one of the projects that won. It is an advanced web application designed specifically for restaurants, allowing them to dynamically adjust their menu pricing based on real-time customer traffic. Utilizing facial recognition technology, their platform not only optimizes pricing strategies but also enhances staff allocation and security measures for staff authentication.
