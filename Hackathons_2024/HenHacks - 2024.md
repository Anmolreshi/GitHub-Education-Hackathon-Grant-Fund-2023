# HenHacks
HenHacks is a beginner-friendly hackathon for all college students of any major. Our goal is to help develop and enhance students' technical skills to help them become competitive applicants in technology-related careers.
- March 2nd-3rd
- University of Delaware
- Newark, Delaware

## Event Summary
- HenHacks 2024 was Delaware's largest and most well-known hackathon, drawing students from 17 universities across 8 disciplines. Over the weekend, participants engaged in hacking, workshops, and fun activities. The event featured 7 hack categories, all focused on social good and community impact, with one category dedicated exclusively to beginner hackers. HenHacks 2024 also experienced nearly 30% growth in attendance compared to the previous year, showcasing the continuous expansion and success of the event.
- HenHacks 2024 featured 8 workshops, including:
    - GitHub Copilot Workshop
    - UI/UX Workshop
    - Autonomous Driving Workshop
    - Imposter Syndrome Workshop
    - DevPost Submission Workshop
    - 3 company “Day in the Life”s Workshops
- HenHacks also featured 10 mini-events aimed towards engaging our hackers. Some of these mini-events included Bingo, Just Dance, and a Lego Competition!
- GitHub played a pivotal role in our event by facilitating collaboration among hackers through shared repositories. We also hosted a GitHub Copilot workshop, where participants were introduced to the tool and learned how to harness its features. We were able to demonstrate to students that with Copilot and leveraging artificial intelligence, anyone can create a project regardless of how much of a language you know. This was significant for our hackathon since it is beginner-friendly. Additionally, we developed a Student GitHub Database, which we shared with our sponsors. Our students were taught about the amazing features of GitHub Education, and the innovative tools that are available to them.

## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics
- HenHacks was aimed towards a target audience of undergraduate students eager to challenge themselves by developing projects for social good in an inclusive environment. Although we didn't focus on specific demographics, we made a conscious effort to attract new hackers by ensuring our event was beginner-friendly.
- We did not collect diversity information from our hackers, as the registration form did not require it.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- We used our grant funds towards our first-place prize for the “Best CS Educational Technology Hack.” This category challenged students to create a project to incorporate computer science into a common curriculum subject.
- Using Github’s grant funds, we were able to make this category competitive with compelling prizes. With the overwhelming influx of technology everywhere, especially after the pandemic, it is imperative that new and innovative technological solutions are implemented in our schools. With this healthy competition we saw creative, high-effort projects submitted to the category. We saw brilliant and feasible solutions that have potential to make lasting impacts to educational programs.

## Top Projects
### HandSlate
HandSlate impressed the judges by addressing a significant communication barrier—creating a tool that translates American Sign Language (ASL) into written text during video calls. This innovative use of generative AI and machine learning is a step forward in making virtual communication more inclusive for ASL speakers.

### Sound-ificator-inator
Their project offers a thoughtful solution for individuals with sensory issues, allowing users to block out unwanted sounds and replace them with a customized audio environment of their choice. By utilizing real-time data to create spatial audio, Sound-ificator-inator opens up new possibilities for sensory accessibility.
