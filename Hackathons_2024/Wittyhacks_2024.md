   One thing that made Wittyhacks 4.0 special was the hacker experience. Hackers had the best time of their hackathon journey during 36 hours as they get to not just build project, but be 
   part of the learning experience, networking and loads of fun at the same time.
  
- Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on. <br>
  We had multiple mini-events, like Karaoke, Cup-Stacking, Morning Drill/Exercise, etc. We also ran various pre-event workshops, which you can find here[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W4uRQlYoUXrkU3wKuvxWPXALDYGkR9dK]
  
- How was **GitHub** featured at your event? <br>
